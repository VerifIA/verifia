    "In this notebook we address a house pricing prediction problem using a CatBoost regression model. We tune the model with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (using BayesSearchCV) on our training data. Next, we wrap the trained model with VerifIA’s CBModel wrapper and generate a domain configuration—using either AI-powered domain generation or loading from a YAML file—to verify that the model’s predictions adhere to the expected domain rules."

      "\n",
      "- Rules define relationships between features and the target variable and indicate how changes in one or more variables \n",
      "    may influence the target variable. Rules typically include a set of premises (conditions) and a conclusion \n",
      "    (the expected effect).\n",
      "\n",
      "Behavior abbreviations for variables:\n",
      "- inc: indicates that the variable is expected to increase.\n",
      "- dec: indicates that the variable is expected to decrease.\n",
      "- cst: indicates that the variable should remain constant.\n",
      "- noinc: indicates that the variable should not increase (i.e., it may decrease or remain constant).\n",
      "- nodec: indicates that the variable should not decrease (i.e., it may increase or remain constant).\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPORTANT:\n",
      "- Output only the JSON object (no extra text, explanation, or markdown).\n",
      "- Ensure that the keys are exactly \"variables\", \"constraints\", and \"rules\".\n",
      "- Do not include any inline comments in the output.\n",
