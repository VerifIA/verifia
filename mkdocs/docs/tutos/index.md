# Tutorials

Welcome to the *VerifIA* **Tutorials**â€”two handsâ€‘on guides that walk you through the core components of *VerifIA* on simplified examples. These tutorials will help you:

- **Understand the endâ€‘toâ€‘end workflow** (data â†’ model wrapping â†’ domain spec â†’ searcher selection -> verification run â†’ reporting)  
- **Get comfortable** with the *VerifIA* API before tackling complex, realâ€‘world use cases  
- **Experiment freely**: tweak parameters, swap algorithms, inspect intermediate results

## Tutorial 1: Ruleâ€‘Based Dummy Regression Verification

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

1. Generate synthetic regression data with known featureâ€“target relationships  
2. Train a scikitâ€‘learn pipeline  
3. Define domain rules in YAML  
4. Wrap the model and run the `RuleConsistencyVerifier`  
5. Inspect and export verification results

## Tutorial 2: Manual vs. AIâ€‘Powered Domain Generation

In this tutorial you will explore two approaches to building your domain configuration on the California Housing dataset:

1. **Manual Domain Dictionary** based on data inspection and expert intuition  
2. **AIâ€‘Powered Generation** using VerifIAâ€™s `DomainGenFlow` (GPTâ€‘assisted)  

Youâ€™ll then verify a wrapped model against those rules and export your results.
