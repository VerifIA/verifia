# Enterprise Feedback

We value the insights of our enterprise users and want to learn how *VerifIA* fits into your model‑verification workflows. Your feedback helps us shape the tool and documentation to better serve real‑world needs.

---

## What We’d Love to Hear

- **Use cases:** What projects or pipelines are you integrating VerifIA into?  
- **Strengths:** Which features or concepts have been most valuable?  
- **Pain points:** Where did you struggle—installation, configuration, domain definition, search performance?  
- **Wish list:** What enhancements or new capabilities would make VerifIA more effective for your team?

## How to Connect

If you’re an enterprise user and would like to share your experience, please email us at **contact@verifia.ca** with:

- **Company name**  
- **How you’re using VerifIA** (e.g. “verifying credit‑scoring models” or “auditing production classifiers”)  
- **Topics or questions** you’d like to discuss  

We’ll follow up to schedule a 30‑minute call. This conversation is **not** technical support—it’s an open dialogue to understand your workflows, challenges, and ideas.
