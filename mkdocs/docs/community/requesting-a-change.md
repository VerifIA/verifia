Please do the following preliminary work to ensure your idea fits VerifIA’s scope and philosophy:

1. **Not a bug**  
   Change requests are for new features or behavior changes, not bug reports. If you’ve found a bug, see our [bug report guide].

2. **Gather inspiration**  
   If you’ve seen this feature in another tool or library, collect links or examples. Explaining what you like helps us assess fit quickly.
