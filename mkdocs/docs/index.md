# VerifIA

*VerifIA* is an open-source AI testing framework for **domain‚Äëaware verification** of machine‚Äëlearning models during the staging phase‚Äîbefore deployment.

> **Definition:** The <u>staging phase</u> encompasses model training on the training set, hyperparameter tuning on the validation set, and performance evaluation on the test set. During this phase, models must satisfy domain-specific requirements and regulatory standards before advancing to production.

Fundamentally, *VerifIA* automates a structured sequence of verifications to assess model consistency with domain knowledge. At the end of each run, it generates a validation report to:

1. **Inform deployment decisions** by operations teams.
2. **Guide engineers** in debugging and enhancing pipeline robustness.

## Why VerifIA?

Most production AI systems today rely on mature, open‚Äësource frameworks‚Äîscikit‚Äëlearn, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow‚Äîthat keep pace with the latest research and hardware accelerators. While these libraries empower practitioners to build state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart models on large datasets, many organizations struggle to fully understand or control the resulting systems.  

- **Rush to Adopt:** Businesses integrating AI into existing analytics workflows often end up with only a partial grasp of model behavior.  
- **Regulatory Pressure:** Rising public concern has led to AI‚Äëspecific policies and soft laws mandating compliance with human‚Äëcentered legal requirements.  
- **Safety‚ÄëCritical Caution:** Industries with zero‚Äëtolerance for failure (e.g. aerospace, healthcare) have hesitated to deploy AI without rigorous quality assurance.  

Even rare but catastrophic AI failures‚Äîwhether due to distributional shifts, spurious correlations, or untested edge cases‚Äîare unacceptable in many domains.

*VerifIA* brings **domain‚Äëaware model verification** to your staging pipeline:

1. **Seamless Integration**

2. **AI‚ÄëAssisted Domain Creation**  
    - Draft your **domain YAML** (variables, constraints, rules) automatically from sample data and documents  
    - Compatible with any LLM via LangChain (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, or on‚Äëpremise models)  

3. **Systematic Verification**  
    - Run a battery of **rule‚Äëconsistency checks** derived from your domain knowledge  
    - Explore out‚Äëof‚Äësample, in‚Äëdomain edge cases via population‚Äëbased searchers  

4. **Actionable Reports**  
    - Generate an interactive **validation report** linked back to your staging model  
    - **Operators** decide deployment readiness  
    - **Engineers** gain debugging insights and quality‚Äëimprovement guidance

## VerifIA Testing Workflow (Arrange‚ÄìAct‚ÄìAssert)

*VerifIA* adopts the well-known **Arrange‚ÄìAct‚ÄìAssert** pattern from software testing, adapted for AI model verification:

1. **Arrange:**

      * Define **application-specific expectations**‚Äîthe domain expert‚Äôs assertions about correct model behavior.
      * Structure these assertions into a formal, machine-verifiable format.

2. **Act:**

      * Generate **synthetic input samples** that reflect the original data distribution and explore beyond it.
      * Support targeted generation within specific input subspaces for deeper analysis.

3. **Assert:**

      * Evaluate the model‚Äôs responses against the arranged expectations.
      * Quantify compliance levels to identify safe operational domains and uncover inconsistencies.

</details>

Forget manual YAML editing‚Äî*VerifIA* can **auto‚Äëdraft your entire domain spec** in minutes. 

Using LangChain‚Äëcompatible LLMs, it ingests:

- **Your data** (CSV, Parquet, DataFrame)  
- **Your documentation** (PDFs, or vectordb)  
- **Your model card** (YAML file or dict)

It then generates a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse `domain.yaml` that includes:

1. **Variable definitions** (types, real‚Äëworld ranges)  
2. **Feasibility constraints** (inter‚Äëfeature formulas)  
3. **Behavioral rules** (premises ‚Üí conclusions)  

!!! tip "Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚ÄëLoop Experience"
    Through the built‚Äëin Gradio interface, you can:
    
    - **Review** the AI‚Äëdrafted spec side‚Äëby‚Äëside.  
    - **Edit** any section inline.  
    - **Regenerate** specific parts on demand.  
    - **Validate** against your schema before export.

## Quickstart

Install *VerifIA* and run your first verification in minutes:

```bash
pip install verifia
```

```python
from verifia.verification import RuleConsistencyVerifier

# 1. Arrange: load your domain rules
verifier = RuleConsistencyVerifier("domain_rules.yaml")

# 2. Act: attach model (card or dict) + data
report = (
    verifier
      .verify(model_card_fpath_or_dict="model_card.yaml")
      .on(data_fpath="test_data.csv")        # .csv, .json, .xlsx, .parquet, .feather, .pkl
      .using("GA")                           # RS, FFA, MFO, GWO, MVO, PSO, WOA, GA, SSA
      .run(pop_size=50, max_iters=100)       # search budget
