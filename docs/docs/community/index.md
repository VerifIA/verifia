### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct] outlines the expectation for all community members to
treat one another with respect, employing inclusive and welcoming language. Our
commitment is to foster a positive and supportive environment, free of
inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior.

We take any violations seriously and will take appropriate action in response to
uphold these values.

**Warning and Blocking Policy:**
To maintain a respectful and constructive community as *VerifIA* grows, we follow a three‚Äëstep process for handling serious or repeated misconduct:

1. **First Warning**
   Users exhibiting inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior receive a formal notice that their actions violate our Code of Conduct. This warning is recorded permanently.

2. **Second Warning & Resolution Period**
   If the behavior continues, a second warning is issued. The user then has **five days** to reflect and, if they choose, publicly address or apologize for their conduct. This period offers a chance to clear up misunderstandings.

3. **Blocking**
   If no improvement or response occurs after five days, we may block the user from our community and repository. This step is a last resort, taken only when necessary to protect our community‚Äôs integrity.

Blocking remains extremely rare in our positive environment, underscoring our commitment to dialogue, respect, and mutual support.


**Thank you** for helping improve *VerifIA* ! We look forward to your contributions.
