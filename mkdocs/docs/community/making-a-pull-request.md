## 2. Pull Request Process

### 2.1 Prepare your changes

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant VerifIA
  participant Fork
  participant Local
  participant PR

  VerifIA ->> Fork: Fork `verifia/verifia`
  Fork ->> Local: Clone fork
  Local ->> Local: git switch -c feature/your-topic
  loop develop
    Local ->> Local: make edits & commit
    Local ->> Fork: git push
    Fork ->> PR: open or update draft PR
    PR ->> PR: review & iterate
  end
```

1. **Fork** the [VerifIA repo] `verifia/verifia`.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/verifia.git
   cd verifia
   ```
3. **Branch** for your work:

   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/describe-your-change
   ```
4. **Develop** with small, focused commits.

5. **Push** often to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/describe-your-change
   ```
6. **Open** a **draft** PR as soon as you have something to show, while referencing an issue.

[VerifIA repo]: https://github.com/verifia/verifia

### 2.2 Keep in sync

If upstream `main` has new commits, merge them into your branch:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/verifia/verifia.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push
```

## 3. Finalizing Your Pull Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant PR
  participant VerifIA
  participant Local

  PR ->> PR: mark as ready for review
  loop review
    PR ->> Local: reviewer comments
    Local ->> Local: address feedback & commit
    Local ->> Fork: git push
  end
  VerifIA ->> PR: maintainer merges (squash)
  Local ->> Local: delete branch
```

1. Change **from draft** to **ready for review**.
2. Receive reviews from a maintainer.
3. Address feedback promptly with commits to your branch.
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge (often squashing commits).

---

## 4. After Merge

1. Delete your topic branch both locally and on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git switch main
   git pull upstream main
   git branch -d feature/describe-your-change
   git push origin --delete feature/describe-your-change
   ```
2. Youâ€™re ready for your next contribution!
